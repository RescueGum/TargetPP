CRISPR multi-screen integration to prioritize multi-phenotype targets

This target prioritization pipeline (TPP, TargetPP) combines existing statistical methods
to integrate multiple CRISPR screens into a single ranking to prioritize targets based on their
significance and effect size, even across multiple phenotypes.

## Installation

You can install the released version of TargetPP by running:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RescueGum/TargetPP")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(TargetPP)
## TODO: basic example code
```
